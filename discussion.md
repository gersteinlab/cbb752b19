## Weekly Discussion Sections & Readings

### Time and Location
TBD

### Format

The standard discussion section involves student presentations on 1 or 2 papers. Some discussion sections will involve hands-on skill-building demos taught by the teaching fellows, such as the use of R, High Performance Computing, and GitHub. 

- The exact format will be determined based on the size of the class. However, tentatively, we require the following
Students are expected to bring approx. a half page (2-3 paragraph) summaries of each paper to the section. (we will collect a hard copy during each session, but if you'd like to save some trees, we will accept electronic submission. Please submit PDF to cbb752 (at) gersteinlab.org BEFORE each section).
- Students will give approx. 20 min presentations about each paper.
- Students will be graded on a combination of the written summary, presentation, and participation in discussions.
