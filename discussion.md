## Weekly Discussion Sections & Readings

### Time and Location

BASS 405 or BASS 205
1:00p - 2:00p

### Format

The standard discussion section involves student presentations on 1 or 2 papers. Some discussion sections will involve hands-on skill-building demos taught by the teaching fellows, such as the use of R, High Performance Computing, and GitHub. 

- The exact format will be determined based on the size of the class. However, we generally require the following:

- Students are expected to bring approx. one page (3-4 paragraph) summaries of each paper to the section. (we will collect a hard copy during each session, but if you'd like to save some trees, we will accept electronic submission. Please submit PDF to cbb752 (at) gersteinlab.org BEFORE each section).
- Students will give approx. 20 min presentations about each paper.
- Students will be graded on a combination of the written summary, presentation, and participation in discussions.
- If you are presenting, you are exempt from writing a summary.
- Please notify TF if you cannot come to a discussion session. Student can miss up to 1 discussion section without a penalty.
