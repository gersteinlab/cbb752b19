## Weekly Discussion Sections & Readings

### Time and Location

BASS 405 (or BASS 205 for 2/8 & 3/1)
1:00p - 2:00p

### Format

The standard discussion section involves student presentations on 1 or 2 papers. Some discussion sections will involve hands-on skill-building demos taught by the teaching fellows, such as the use of R, High Performance Computing, and GitHub. The exact format will be determined based on the size of the class. However, we generally require the following:

* Each week, students are expected to bring approx. one page (3-4 paragraph) summaries of each paper they read to the section. We will collect a hard copy during each session, but if you'd like to save some trees, we will accept electronic submission. Please submit PDF to cbb752 (at) gersteinlab.org BEFORE each section.
* Each student will give one presentation about a selected paper (approx. 20 min).
* Students will be graded on a combination of the written summary, presentation, and participation in discussions.
* If you are presenting, you are exempt from writing a summary.
* Please notify TFs in advance if you cannot come to the discussion session. Student can miss up to one discussion section without a penalty.
